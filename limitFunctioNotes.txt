1) write the function that returns the same array as 
    calculateRowBlockers() but for the columns

[0, 4, 12, 17]

2) write meepleMovesTo(arr, m) that takes an array of positions and a meeple and returns the position that the meeple can move to in either direction (array with two items)
    - This will need to offset by 1 in one direction and NOT do that in the other.
    - I think up/left has the offset

3) adjust move so that it uses:
    * calculateRowBlockers()
    * calculateColBlockers()
    * meepleMovesTo()

In order to apply the new coordinates to the meeples x||y coordinare


Then for greys ability, return row and col blockers. test if the blocker to be ignored is a meeple
