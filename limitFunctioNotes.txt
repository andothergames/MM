3) adjust move so that it uses: 
    * calculateBlockers(row)
    * meepleMovesTo(arr, m, row)
(row is always a boolean, double check we're using the right dimension)

In order to apply the new coordinates to the meeples x||y coordinare


Then for greys ability, return row and col blockers. test if the blocker to be ignored is a meeple
