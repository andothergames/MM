2.5) There's a problem where the index of the meeple is the same as the index of a blocker (AKA it's against a wall)
    I need to remove that blocker but the problem is that it's difficult to do that with DIRECTION

2.7) IT MIGHT BE BEST TO GO BACK TO THE OLD WAY OF DOING THIS AND TO WRITE A DIFFERENT FUNCTION FOR THE LIMIT BASED ABILITIES.
    - FOR GREY, TAKE EVERY DIRECTION AND FIND THE NEAREST WALL - IGNORE DIRECTIONS WHERE THE FIRST THING YOU FIND IS A MEEPLE.

3) adjust move so that it uses: 
    * calculateBlockers(row)
    * meepleMovesTo(arr, m, row)
(row is always a boolean, double check we're using the right dimension)

In order to apply the new coordinates to the meeples x||y coordinare


Then for greys ability, return row and col blockers. test if the blocker to be ignored is a meeple
